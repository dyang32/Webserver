My role in the group was Researcher

I wanted to make a website with a menu system so that each group could have ther own section along with a homepage to use as a central location to find every groups information.

I used Dreamweaver because it incorporates HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, JQuery into one application and is easy to use.

`### Dreamweaver
* Dreamweaver is an all-in-one visual development tool for creating, publishing, and managing websites and mobile content.

I used FileZilla to transfer the files from the website's GitHub repository (https://github.com/taimaishuze/sootsplash.html) over to the Sootsplash server (https://sootsplash.csci2461.com).

### FileZilla
* FileZilla provides easy to use FTP and SFTP, for this project we used SFTP
### SFTP
* SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) is a network protocol that does different types of file transfers, acess, and management over a reliable and secure connection.
* SFTP runs over an SSH session, usualy on TCP port 22.
