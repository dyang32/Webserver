I used FileZilla to transfer the files from the website's GitHub repository (https://github.com/taimaishuze/sootsplash.html) over to the Sootsplash server (https://sootsplash.csci2461.com).

# FileZilla

FileZilla provides easy to use FTP and SFTP, for this project we used SFTP

SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) is a network protocol that does different types of file transfers, acess, and management over a reliable and secure connection.
SFTP runs over an SSH session, usualy on TCP port 22.
