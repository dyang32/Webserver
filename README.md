My role in the group was Researcher

I wanted to make a website with a menu system so that each group could have ther own section along with a homepage to use as a central location to find every groups information.

I used Dreamweaver because it incorporates HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, JQuery into one application and is easy to use.

I used FileZilla to transfer the files from the website's GitHub repository (https://github.com/taimaishuze/sootsplash.html) over to the Sootsplash server (https://sootsplash.csci2461.com).
