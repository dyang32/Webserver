I wanted to make a website with a menu system so that each group could have ther own section. Also, I wanted the homepage to be a central location to find every teams information. I decided to used Dreamweaver because it incorporates HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, and many more into one application that's easy to use.
* **Dreamweaver** - Is an all-in-one visual development tool for creating, publishing, and managing websites and mobile content.
* **HTML** - (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages.
* **CSS** - (Cascading Style Sheets) describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or other media.
* **JavaScript** - JavaScript is the programming language of HTML Allows you to implement complex things on web pages.
* **Bootstrap** - Bootstrap is a free and open-source front-end library for designing websites and web applications. It contains HTML, CSS and JavaScrtipt.




I used FileZilla to transfer the files from the website's GitHub repository (https://github.com/taimaishuze/sootsplash.html) over to the Sootsplash server (https://sootsplash.csci2461.com).
* **FileZilla** - Provides easy to use FTP and SFTP, for this project we used SFTP.
* **SFTP** (SSH File Transfer Protocol) - Is a network protocol that does different types of file transfers, file acess, and file management over a reliable and secure connection. SFTP runs over an SSH session, usualy on TCP port 22.
