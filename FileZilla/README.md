I used FileZile to transfer the files from the website's GitHub repository over to the Sootsplash server.

# FileZilla

FileZilla provides easy to use FTP and SFTP 

SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) is a network protocol that does different types of file transfers, acess, and management over a reliable and secure connection.
SFTP runs over an SSH session, usualy on TCP port 22.
